far vision- The case management reports system will summarize all of the patient data including overall demographics(age, gender, race/ethnicity, income), insurance types, population health reporting, missed visit reporting, revenue based reporting and other regulatory reports. This will provide aggregate information about the patients and the staff case loads to the case managers as well as highlight discrepancies among patients that require immediate attention.
